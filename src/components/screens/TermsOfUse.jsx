                    is
                    making the App available to you. Before you use the App, however, you will need to agree to these

                <p className={styles.paragraphbold}>Account and Wallet Setup</p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    To use the App, you will need to register an account on the App and use a supported electronic
                    wallet,
                    which will enable you to purchase and store collectibles that you collect or purchase via the App.
                    Each
                    collectible is a Non-Fungible Token (an “NFT”). You must provide accurate and complete registration
                    information when you create an account for the App. By creating an account, you agree to provide
                    accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly
                    update
                    your account information as necessary. We reserve the right reclaim usernames without liability to
                    you.
                </p>

                <p className={styles.paragraphbold}> Account Transactions</p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    You can use your electronic wallet to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using your credit
                    card, or
                    via one or more cryptocurrencies that we may elect to accept from time to time.
                </p>

                <p className={styles.paragraphbold}> Purchasing NFTs</p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    The App allows you to purchase, earn, collect and display NFTs. You can purchase NFTs in two ways:
                    (a)
                    by
                    buying NFTs from us on the App; or (b) by buying NFTs from other users in the App’s marketplace (the
                    “Marketplace”). There are different types of NFTs available for purchase on the App, and we reserve
                    the
                    right to modify the types, prices and numbers of NFTs available at our discretion. We strongly
                    encourage
                    you
                    to only purchase NFTs through the App. Any payments or financial transactions that you engage in via
                    the
                    App
                    will be conducted solely through our network, subject to the auction terms below. We have no control
                    over
                    these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions.
                    We
                    have
                    no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of
                    any
                    payments or transactions that you engage in via the App, or any other payment or transactions that
                    you
                    conduct via our network.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.paragraphbold}> Transaction Fees</p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    Every transaction on our network requires the payment of a transaction fee (each, a “Transaction
                    Fee”).
                    This
                    means that you will need to pay a Transaction Fee for each transaction that you instigate via the
                    App.
                    Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, you will be solely responsible to pay any
                    Transaction Fee for any transaction that you instigate via the App.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.paragraphbold}> Responsibility for Taxes</p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties,
                    and
                    assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental
                    authority (collectively, the “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App. Except for income taxes
                    levied on
                    us, you will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and
                    assessments of
                    any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties,
                    customs
                    or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services
                    performed
                    or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any
                    national,
                    state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction.
